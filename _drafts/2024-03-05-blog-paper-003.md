Abstract
------

* This paper presents a method for predicting the above ground leafless biomass of trees in a non destructive way.
* All scans include a large number of noise points; denoising procedures are presented in detail.
* While tree compartments with a diameter **larger than 10 cm** can be modeled accurately, smaller ones, especially twigs with a diameter **smaller than 4 cm**, are often largely overestimated.
