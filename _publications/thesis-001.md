Abstract
------

* Germplasm resources are the foundation of human survival and development, and germplasm preservation is of significant importance. Cryopreservation is a method for long-term preservation of germplasm, typically referring to a biotechnological approach of storing biological materials at -196°C (liquid nitrogen temperature). It is currently a hot topic in international germplasm preservation. However, its application in the preservation of seeds from landscape trees is not yet widespread.

* The present research focuses on 24 species of landscape tree seeds, determining their vitality and moisture content. Additionally, it investigates the germination and growth conditions of seeds after cryopreservation at different time intervals, as well as their performance upon field sowing. The aim is to explore the feasibility and technical methods of cryopreservation for these 24 species of garden tree seeds. The results are as follows:
  * Among the 24 species of landscape tree seeds studied, seeds from 7 species including ***Syringa oblata***, ***Lonicera maackiie***, ***Acer truncatum***, ***Chimonanthus praecox***, ***Berberis thunbergii 'Atropurpurea'***, ***Albizia julibrissin*** and ***Forsythia suspensa*** retain their germination ability after 30-50 days of cryopreservation.
  * Seeds from 5 species including ***Syringa oblata***, ***Acer truncatum***, ***Chimonanthus praecox***, ***Albizia julibrissin***, and ***Forsythia suspensa*** still possess the ability to develop into healthy plants after being sown in the field following 30-50 days of cryopreservation. Their growth condition shows no significant difference compared to the control group. Cryopreservation technology is feasible for the application of these 5 species of seeds.
  * Seeds from ***Lonicera maackii*** and ***Acer truncatum*** experience significant enhancement in germination after undergoing cryopreservation for a minimum of 30 days. Additionally, there is a notable decrease in the germination time for ***Acer truncatum*** seeds.
  * Germination rate of ***Syringa oblata*** seeds significantly increases after 10 days of cryopreservation. However, after 30 days of cryopreservation, the germination rate is lower than that of the 10-day treatment but higher than the control group. This indicates that cryopreservation treatments of different durations have varying effects on the germination of ***Syringa oblata*** seeds, and further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment duration.
  
* Key words: Cryopreservation, germplasm preservation, seeds, landscape trees

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background

* For most landscape trees, seeds are easily obtainable, and seed propagation is widely used in nurseries.

* Conventional germplasm preservation of woody plants is limited by factors such as land, manpower, high cost, low efficiency, and genetic variation is prone to occur during the preservation process. The application of cryopreservation in woody plants greatly maintains genetic stability of germplasm, which holds certain potential value for garden trees.

### 1.2 Research status

* From previous research, studies on cryopreservation have primarily focused on crops, medicinal plants, and economically significant forest trees. Research specifically targeting cryopreservation of landscape trees has been relatively limited.

### 1.3 Research purpose

* This research focuses on 24 common landscape tree species and aims to explore the feasibility and technical methods of cryopreservation of their seeds. Additionally, it discusses the impact of liquid nitrogen preservation duration on the tested seeds. The goal is to provide methods and support for the multi-level preservation of planting resources for landscape trees, thus enhancing the safety of the germplasm preservation.

### 1.4 Research approach and technical route

* Initially, the basic information of the seeds was determined, including observations of seed morphology, size, and measurement of seed moisture content.
* Subsequently, the seeds were subjected to 1-hour liquid nitrogen treatment, with room temperature storage serving as a control.
* The viability of the seeds was assessed using the Tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining method to preliminarily determine if these 24 species of landscape tree seeds could maintain activity after liquid nitrogen treatment.
* After the assessment, the 24 species of seeds were subjected to liquid nitrogen preservation for no less than 30 days, with a subset also preserved for 10 days, again with room temperature storage as a control.
* Laboratory germination rates of the seeds after liquid nitrogen preservation were measured, and the outdoor sowing performance of seeds preserved for over 30 days in liquid nitrogen was evaluated.
* Based on the experimental results, the feasibility of ultra-low temperature preservation and the establishment of technical methods for such preservation were determined for these 24 species of landscape tree seeds.

## 2 Materials and methods

### 2.1 Materials

* The study utilized seeds from 24 common landscape tree species as experimental materials.

### 2.2 Methods

#### 2.2.1 Observation and record of seed size and morphology

* Randomly select an appropriate amount of seeds on graph paper, and take photos to record the morphology and size of each species of seed.

#### 2.2.2 Determination of seed moisture

* Take 30 seeds of each species as a sample, evenly spread them in a sample box;
* Place them in the oven, and start timing when the oven reaches 103°C ± 2°C, maintaining it for 12 hours; then transfer them to a desiccator for cooling for 30 minutes.
* Seeds with a diameter greater than or equal to 15mm and seeds with hard seed coats are sliced and measured.
* After cutting the large seeds into 4-5 pieces, approximately equivalent to the amount of 5 intact seeds are randomly selected from them for measurement, ensuring that the total exposure time to air during the entire operation does not exceed 60 minutes.
* Each species is repeated 3 times.

* Weigh the covered sample box without the sample as M1;
* after adding the sample, the weight of the sample box along with the lid is M2;
* after drying and cooling, the weight of the sample and the sample box along with the lid is M3;
* Unit in grams, rounded to 3 decimal places.
* The final moisture content is expressed as a percentage and calculated using the following formula, with the moisture content of each seed type being the average of the three repetitions.

<div align="center">
\[ \text{Moisture content (\%)} = \left( \frac{{M2 - M3}}{{M2 - M1}} \right) \times 100\% \]
</div>
