Abstract
------

* Germplasm resources are the foundation of human survival and development, and germplasm preservation is of significant importance. Cryopreservation is a method for long-term preservation of germplasm, typically referring to a biotechnological approach of storing biological materials at -196°C (liquid nitrogen temperature). It is currently a hot topic in international germplasm preservation. However, its application in the preservation of seeds from landscape trees is not yet widespread.

* The present research focuses on 24 species of landscape tree seeds, determining their vitality and moisture content. Additionally, it investigates the germination and growth conditions of seeds after cryopreservation at different time intervals, as well as their performance upon field sowing. The aim is to explore the feasibility and technical methods of cryopreservation for these 24 species of garden tree seeds. The results are as follows:
  * Among the 24 species of landscape tree seeds studied, seeds from 7 species including ***Syringa oblata***, ***Lonicera maackiie***, ***Acer truncatum***, ***Chimonanthus praecox***, ***Berberis thunbergii 'Atropurpurea'***, ***Albizia julibrissin*** and ***Forsythia suspensa*** retain their germination ability after 30-50 days of cryopreservation.
  * Seeds from 5 species including ***Syringa oblata***, ***Acer truncatum***, ***Chimonanthus praecox***, ***Albizia julibrissin***, and ***Forsythia suspensa*** still possess the ability to develop into healthy plants after being sown in the field following 30-50 days of cryopreservation. Their growth condition shows no significant difference compared to the control group. Cryopreservation technology is feasible for the application of these 5 species of seeds.
  * Seeds from ***Lonicera maackii*** and ***Acer truncatum*** experience significant enhancement in germination after undergoing cryopreservation for a minimum of 30 days. Additionally, there is a notable decrease in the germination time for ***Acer truncatum*** seeds.
  * Germination rate of ***Syringa oblata*** seeds significantly increases after 10 days of cryopreservation. However, after 30 days of cryopreservation, the germination rate is lower than that of the 10-day treatment but higher than the control group. This indicates that cryopreservation treatments of different durations have varying effects on the germination of ***Syringa oblata*** seeds, and further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment duration.
  
* Key words: Cryopreservation, germplasm preservation, seeds, landscape trees
