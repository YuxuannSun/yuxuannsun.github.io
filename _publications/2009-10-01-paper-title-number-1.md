excerpt: 'Through continuous Terrestrial Laser Scanning(TLS) of the ancient Koelreuteria paniculata in Yantai Mountain, Yantai, Shandong Province, point cloud data from different periods were obtained, and a quantitative structure model(QSM) of the ancient tree was reconstructed as the basis of the digital twin model. The model was analyzed, and its parameters reflecting growth conditions such as tree height and diameter at breast height(DBH) were more accurately obtained by interacting with the landscape information modeling(LIM) environment. The real form and dynamic changes in growth of the ancient tree were visualized in the LIM environment. This provides information technology methods and quantitative data references for the protection of ancient famous trees, digital basis and support for the design, construction, and operation of landscape engineering projects, and application pathways and directions for digital twin technology in the protection of ancient and famous trees.'

通过对山东省烟台市烟台山古栾树进行持续地面激光雷达扫描，获取了其不同时期的点云数据，构建了该古树的量化结构模型，作为数字孪生模型的基础。对该模型进行数据分析并将其与LIM环境进行交互，更准确地获取了该古树树高、胸径等反应其生长状况的参数，并在LIM环境中可视化地呈现了该古树真实形态与生长的动态变化等情况。为古树名木保护提供了信息化的技术方法与定量的数据参考；为风景园林工程项目的设计、建造和运营等过程提供了数字化的依据与支撑；为数字孪生技术提供了面向古树名木保护的应用途径与方向。
