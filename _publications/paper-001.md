## Abstract:
* Through continuous Terrestrial Laser Scanning(TLS) of the ancient Koelreuteria paniculata in Yantai Mountain, Yantai, Shandong Province, point cloud data from different periods were obtained, and a quantitative structure model(QSM) of the ancient tree was reconstructed as the basis of the digital twin model.
* By analyzing the model, its parameters reflecting growth conditions such as tree height and diameter at breast height(DBH) were more accurately obtained.
* By interacting with the landscape information modeling(LIM) environment, the real form and dynamic changes in growth of the ancient tree were visualized. This provides information technology methods and quantitative data references for the protection of ancient famous trees, digital basis and support for the design, construction, and operation of landscape engineering projects, and application pathways and directions for digital twin technology in the protection of ancient and famous trees.
