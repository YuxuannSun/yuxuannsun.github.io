<!--
I'm now looking for opportunities as an intern/visiting student/research assistant in a suitable research team for further study.
-->

I'm currently a Master's student at Department of Landscape Architecture, Tsinghua University.

Additionally, I'm interning with the cPlant Team [formerly known as GreenLab, a LIAMA (Sino-French Laboratory in Computer Sciences, Automation and Applied Mathmatics) project launched in 1998, associate team of INRIA Digiplant Project, now led by [Prof. Dr. Mengzhen Kang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~kangmengzhen?language=en)] at State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research interests are in **point cloud data processing**, **plant modeling** and their **applications**.

<!--
* **Point clouds data processing:**<br>
  The first time I encountered point clouds was in an engineering project. At that time, point clouds, as a novel type of surveying data, provided precise three-dimensional spatial information for the real world, including terrain, vegetation, buildings, and various other elements. This data served as the foundation for quantitative data analysis in engineering projects.<br>

  Processing and analyzing point cloud data can reveal valuable information about the real world, enabling quantitative descriptions of reality. Additionally, this information can be applied in various fields of research such as ecology, forestry, plant science and many other engineering fields.<br> 

* **Plant modeling:**<br>
  During my undergraduate studies, my research on  plant germplasm conservation laid the groundwork for my interest in plant modeling. My first published paper discussed how to reconstruct three-dimensional models of ancient trees using point cloud data, and how to extract information from them, thereby contributing to the conservation of ancient trees.<br>

  After reading numerous existing research papers, I learned that three-dimensional modeling of plants is relevant in multiple fields. Functional-Structral Plant Model(FSPM) has been established in both computer graphics and plant science field, used to represent plant structure and the physiological or physical processes of its growth development[^1].<br>
  
  Moreover, point clouds provide authentic three-dimensional configuration parameters for plant within specific spatiotemporal contexts.Therefore, the integration of FSPM with point clouds is also a research direction that interests me.<br>

* **Applications:**<br>
  As mentioned above, the real world provides an application scenario for both aspects. Many existing scientific problems can be addressed using new technological methods, which is also a direction I hope to explore.<br>
