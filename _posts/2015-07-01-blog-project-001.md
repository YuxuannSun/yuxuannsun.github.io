* We selected several concentrated communities of ancient trees and famous trees, including Wuhan University, Baotong Temple, Shouyi Park, and East Lake Area (including [Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy Of Sciences](http://english.wbg.cas.cn/)), for on-site survey and recording.

* We recorded information such as tree height, diameter at breast height, crown width, growth status, site environmental conditions, damage from pests and diseases, protective measures, etc.

* We visited Wuhan City's most famous ancient tree (a ***Ginkgo biloba***) and interviewed experts in the maintenance of ancient and famous trees from the Garden and Forestry Administration. We sought to understand the current resources of ancient and famous trees in Wuhan and consulted them about techniques related to the maintenance and rejuvenation of ancient trees.
