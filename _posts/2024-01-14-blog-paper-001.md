Abstract
------

>**Background:** Woody plants (trees and shrubs) play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems, but their size and longevity make them difficult subjects for traditional experiments. In the last 20 years functional–structural plant models (FSPMs) have evolved: they consider the interplay between plant modular structure, the immediate environment and internal functioning. However, **computational constraints** and **data deficiency** have long been limiting factors in a broader application of FSPMs, particularly at the scale of forest communities. Recently, **terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)**, has emerged as an invaluable tool for **capturing the 3-D structure** of forest communities, thus opening up exciting opportunities to explore and predict forest dynamics with FSPMs.

* Computational constraints and data deficiency is the limitation of FSPM.
* TLS provides the data.

>**Scope:** The potential synergies[n. 协同效应] between TLS-derived data and FSPMs have yet to be fully explored. Here, we summarize recent developments in FSPM and TLS research, with a specific focus on woody plants. We then evaluate the emerging opportunities for applying FSPMs in an ecological and evolutionary context, in light of TLS-derived data, with particular consideration of the challenges posed by scaling up from individual trees to whole forests. Finally, **we propose guidelines for incorporating TLS data into the FSPM workflow** to encourage overlap of practice amongst researchers.

* The paper provides the guidelines.

>**Conclusions:** We conclude that TLS is a feasible[adj. 可行的] tool to help shift FSPMs from an individual-level modelling technique to a community-level one. The ability to scan multiple trees, of multiple species, in a short amount of time, is paramount[adj. 首要的] to gathering the detailed structural information required for parameterizing FSPMs for forest communities. Conventional techniques, such as repeated manual forest surveys, have their limitations in explaining the driving mechanisms behind observed patterns in 3-D forest structure and dynamics. Therefore, other techniques are valuable to explore how forests might respond to environmental change. A robust synthesis[n. 综合] between TLS and FSPMs provides the opportunity to virtually explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest communities.

* Using TLS + FSPM to virtually explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest communities is feasible.



Introduction

Some inspiring parts: 

>Now there is a potential game changer: a combination of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and highly detailed functional–structural plant models (FSPMs) that mimic actual plants (e.g. Louarn and Song, 2020) Together, they provide a pair of tools that fulfil many prerequisites for addressing challenges with research questions related to the structural dynamics of forests.

>Terrestrial laser scanning, optionally complemented with scanning from unmanned aerial vehicles, is a method that enables capturing the full 3-D structure of a forest stand with close to centimetre-level detail in a short amount of time (Liang et al., 2016; Calders et al., 2020), including the identification of individual trees and their species (Xi et al., 2020), the ground vegetation (Muumbe et al., 2021) and the topography of the terrain (Diamond et al., 2020). **Methods for collecting additional spectral information to estimate the state of various physiological processes within trees along with the structural scanning are also being developed (Junttila et al., 2021).**

>Functional–structural plant models, in turn, are models that aim to integrate the dynamic development of 3-D plant architecture, the associated physiological functions of the plant, and the simultaneous influence of external factors present in the growth environment (Fig. 1). As they operate with the 3-D architectural form of plants and plant stands, FSPMs are suitable for exploring the effects of different constituents of structural diversity on the dynamic behaviour of ecosystems. However, the applicability of FSPMs has so far been **limited, much due to the amount of required data and high computational demands of the models**; hence the existing models typically cover the spatial extent of just a few tree individuals (Sievänen et  al., 2008; Zhang and DeAngelis 2020). On the other hand, one of the former limitations in the development of FSPMs, the availability of structural data for the construction and validation of models, is now changing as FSPMs are suited to directly utilize data provided by TLS, and use it to develop models that explore long-term dynamic processes within trees and stands (Sievänen et al., 2018).

>In this review, we will focus on recent developments of TLS and FSPMs, evaluate their current capabilities in data collection and modelling capacity, and evaluate the current and anticipated future applicability of these techniques in solving ecological and evolutionary questions when used in combination. 
>* In the first of the following three sections we will address the impact of plant architecture on vegetation modelling from the individual plant level to the forest level and the impacts of forest evolution. 
>* In the second section we will explore FSPMs and their three different sub-models: (1) physiological, (2) environmental and (3) architectural. 
>* In the third section we will evaluate the realm of TLS and the benefits that this field has to scale up FSPMs from an individual-level modelling paradigm[n. 范式] to a community-level modelling paradigm. 
>* In the third section we also propose a potential TLS to FSPM workflow, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of data collection and software involved. 
>* Lastly, we discuss the current and future synergies between TLS and FSPM for modelling forest communities.
