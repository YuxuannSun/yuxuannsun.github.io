Abstract
------

>**Background:** Woody plants (trees and shrubs) play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems, but their size and longevity make them difficult subjects for traditional experiments. In the last 20 years functional–structural plant models (FSPMs) have evolved: they consider the interplay between plant modular structure, the immediate environment and internal functioning. However, **computational constraints** and **data deficiency** have long been limiting factors in a broader application of FSPMs, particularly at the scale of forest communities. Recently, **terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)**, has emerged as an invaluable tool for **capturing the 3-D structure** of forest communities, thus **opening up exciting opportunities to explore and predict forest dynamics with FSPMs**.

* Computational constraints and data deficiency is the limitation of FSPM.
* TLS provides the data.
* What is the limitation of TLS?

>**Scope:** The potential **synergies[n. 协同效应]** between TLS-derived data and FSPMs have yet to be fully explored. Here, we summarize recent developments in FSPM and TLS research, with a specific focus on woody plants. We then evaluate the emerging opportunities for applying FSPMs in an ecological and evolutionary context, in light of TLS-derived data, with particular consideration of the challenges posed by scaling up from individual trees to whole forests. Finally, **we propose guidelines for incorporating TLS data into the FSPM workflow** to encourage overlap of practice amongst researchers.

* The paper provides the guidelines.

>**Conclusions:** We conclude that TLS is a **feasible[adj. 可行的]** tool to help shift FSPMs from an individual-level modelling technique to a community-level one. The ability to scan multiple trees, of multiple species, in a short amount of time, is **paramount[adj. 首要的]** to gathering the detailed structural information required for parameterizing FSPMs for forest communities. Conventional techniques, such as repeated manual forest surveys, have their limitations in explaining the driving mechanisms behind observed patterns in 3-D forest structure and dynamics. Therefore, other techniques are valuable to explore how forests might respond to environmental change. A robust **synthesis[n. 综合]** between TLS and FSPMs provides the opportunity to virtually explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest communities.

* Using TLS + FSPM to virtually explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest communities is feasible.



Introduction

>How individual trees and shrubs occupy 3-D space is a defining feature of forest ecosystem dynamics (Dıaz and Cabido, 2001; McDowell et al., 2020). Plant architecture, the physical form of a plant as derived from the balance between internal and external processes, is a central but often overlooked element of forest ecology and evolution (Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007). Individual-level form and function, in combination with the environment, ultimately contributes to overall forest ecosystem level processes, determining the biodiversity found within them, as well as the regulation of energy, water and nutrient fluxes. There are still many unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms that give rise to observable patterns of biodiversity, form and function in forests worldwide (Givnish, 1999;Condit et al., 2006; Bohn and Huth, 2017). **Elucidating[n. 阐明]** the role of structure in these mechanisms is a crucial step in predicting the ecological and evolutionary responses of vegetation to forecasted climate change, deforestation or species invasions at the scale of forests and also at the scale of individual trees and shrubs (**henceforth[adv. 从此之后]** referred to as ‘woody plants’).

>One way to characterize the relationship between biodiversity and the structure of forest environments is through the lens of structural diversity (Tews et al., 2004), which denotes ‘the physical arrangement and variability of the living and non-living biotic elements within forest stands’ (LaRue et al., 2020), and acts on its own as a good predictor of many ecosystem functions (Felipe-Lucia et al., 2018; LaRue et al., 2019). Recently, efforts have been made to formalize the role of **structural[v. 形式化]** traitdiversity in forest ecology and evolution with the development of a ‘plant structural economic spectrum’ to complement the existing ‘wood economic spectrum’ and ‘leaf economic spectrum’ (Verbeeck et al., 2019).

>Structural diversity is generated through spatially varying factors that determine the availability of microhabitats within the area, setting preconditions for the existence of different species with varying niche requirements (Svenning, 1999; Dymytrova et al., 2016). Spatially varying microhabitats arise from factors such as small-scale variation in soil properties (Matkala et al., 2020), landscape topography (Zuleta et al., 2020), hydrological features of the terrain (Francis et  al., 2020), and the inflows and outflows of biologically active material (including plants, animals, **fungi[n. 真菌]**, microbes, nutrients) to and from the forest of interest (Honkaniemi et al., 2021).

>Further structural diversity is generated (1) through dynamic 3-D growth and development of woody plants and other **herbaceous[adj. 草本的]** vegetation within a forest stand and (2) through constantly changing environmental factors, such as weather, and a wide choice of unpredictable anthropogenic and natural disturbances (land use, global warming, wind, fire, snow, pest outbreaks, landslides etc.), as well as (3) through temporal changes in the inflow and outflow of biologically active material. The growth of woody plants alone causes temporal changes, because it alters individual plant architecture (3-D spatial arrangement of the plant structure), creating within-plant structural diversity through microenvironments within branches and foliage, i.e. due to different structural features (Escudero et al., 2017; Asbeck et  al., 2019), self-shading (Ventre-Lespiaucq et  al., 2016) or weather (Nock et  al., 2016). Heterogeneous microenvironments inside a crown can thus alter growth habits (Koyama et  al., 2020) and the functioning of foliage (Ngao et al., 2017; Curtis et al., 2019). Growth of individual plants changes the spatial structure of the whole forest stand (e.g. canopy layers, canopy cover, gap dynamics, tree size variation), and, in combination with the flow of dead material from woody plants to the ground, generates further changes in the structural diversity and choice of microhabitats available (Kaufmann et  al., 2018). This results in the well-known natural succession of forest stands over decades (Boukili and Chazdon, 2017; Hilmers et al., 2018). In yet longer temporal scales, this results in evolution over centuries to millennia as biological adaptations to changing and often unpredictable growth conditions appear (Areces-Berazain et al., 2021).

>Given all the constituents of structural diversity, it is clear that representative sampling of dynamically changing individual woody plant and forest characteristics is challenging. Even at the scale of individual woody plants, for instance in studies of the growth and architectural form of particular species, it can be challenging to explain the observations without information about the spatial structure of the growing site (Lintunen and Kaitaniemi, 2010; Kunz et al., 2019; Hildebrand et al., 2021), about the architectural structure and functioning of the individual itself (Posada et al., 2009; Kennedy 2010), and without information about the temporal dynamics that are likely in the typical growth environment (Ishii et al., 2018).

>Traditional forest research can be labour-intensive and timeconsuming. Detailed structural measurements of individual woody plants across a large stand have often been consideredimpossible and, instead, allometric or other structural relationships are used as proxies for multiple structural traits (Condés et al., 2020). Destructive sampling or special climbing constructions have been essential to reach the top of large trees (Barker and Pinard, 2001). In addition, a long time-series beyond a typical researcher’s career would be required to capture the full dynamics of individual and stand development over time.

Some inspiring parts: 

>Now there is **a potential game changer**: a combination of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and highly detailed functional–structural plant models (FSPMs) that mimic actual plants (e.g. Louarn and Song, 2020) Together, they provide a pair of tools that fulfil many prerequisites for addressing challenges with research questions related to the structural dynamics of forests.

>Terrestrial laser scanning, optionally complemented with scanning from unmanned aerial vehicles, is a method that enables capturing the full 3-D structure of a forest stand with close to centimetre-level detail in a short amount of time (Liang et al., 2016; Calders et al., 2020), including the identification of individual trees and their species (Xi et al., 2020), the ground vegetation (Muumbe et al., 2021) and the topography of the terrain (Diamond et al., 2020). **Methods for collecting additional spectral information to estimate the state of various physiological processes within trees along with the structural scanning are also being developed (Junttila et al., 2021).**

>Functional–structural plant models, in turn, are models that aim to integrate the dynamic development of 3-D plant architecture, the associated physiological functions of the plant, and the simultaneous influence of external factors present in the growth environment (Fig. 1). As they operate with the 3-D architectural form of plants and plant stands, FSPMs are suitable for exploring the effects of different constituents of structural diversity on the dynamic behaviour of ecosystems. However, the applicability of FSPMs has so far been limited, much due to the amount of required data and high computational demands of the models; hence the existing models typically cover the spatial extent of just a few tree individuals (Sievänen et  al., 2008; Zhang and DeAngelis 2020). On the other hand, one of the former limitations in the development of FSPMs, the availability of structural data for the construction and validation of models, is now changing as FSPMs are suited to directly utilize data provided by TLS, and use it to develop models that explore long-term dynamic processes within trees and stands (Sievänen et al., 2018).

* FSPM

>In this review, we will focus on recent developments of TLS and FSPMs, evaluate their current capabilities in data collection and modelling capacity, and evaluate the current and anticipated future applicability of these techniques in solving ecological and evolutionary questions when used in combination. In the first of the following three sections we will address the impact of plant architecture on vegetation modelling from the individual plant level to the forest level and the impacts of forest evolution. In the second section we will explore FSPMs and their three different sub-models: (1) physiological, (2) environmental and (3) architectural. In the third section we will evaluate the realm of TLS and the benefits that this field has to scale up FSPMs from an individual-level modelling paradigm to a community-level modelling paradigm. In the third section we also propose a potential TLS to FSPM workflow, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of data collection and software involved. Lastly, we discuss the current and future synergies between TLS and FSPM for modelling forest communities.
