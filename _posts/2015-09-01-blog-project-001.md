Against the backdrop of increasing importance placed on the protection of ancient and famous trees in China, we formed a team from the School of Landscape Architecture at Beijing Forestry University, traveled to Wuhan to conduct field investigations in areas where ancient and famous trees are concentrated within the city. The team conducted scientific assessments of the growth locations and surrounding environments of these ancient trees.We aimed at mastering the methods for investigating ancient trees, and gaining an understanding of specific protection measures for them.

We selected several concentrated communities of ancient trees and famous trees, including Wuhan University, Baotong Temple, Shouyi Park, and East Lake Area (including [Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy Of Sciences](http://english.wbg.cas.cn/)), for on-site survey and recording.

We recorded information such as tree height, diameter at breast height, crown width, growth status, site environmental conditions, damage from pests and diseases, protective measures, etc., as depicted in Figure 3-5.

<p>We visited Wuhan City's most famous ancient tree (a ***Ginkgo biloba***) and interviewed experts in the maintenance of ancient and famous trees from the Garden and Forestry Administration. We sought to understand the current resources of ancient and famous trees in Wuhan and consulted them about techniques related to the maintenance and rejuvenation of ancient trees.</p>

<p>In this field survey, we investigated a total of 41 ancient and famous trees, representing 14 species from 12 families, Among them, there were 8 <b><em>Ginkgo biloba</em></b> from the <b><em>Ginkgoaceae</em></b> family, accounting for 19.51% of the total, and 13 <b><em>Celtis julianae</em></b> from the <b><em>Ulmaceae</em></b> family, accounting for 31.71%. Among these 14 species, 10 are indigenous species, accounting for 87.80% of the total number, such as the <b><em>Sinojackia xylocarpa</em></b>, <b><em>Ginkgo biloba</em></b>, and <b><em>Celtis julianae</em></b>. Some are long-standing introduced species, such as the <b><em>Pinus thunbergii</em></b> introduced from the south temperate zone of Asia, the <b><em>Platanus orientalis</em></b> introduced from Europe, and the <b><em>Camphora officinarum</em></b> introduced from the subtropics, as is shown in Table 1.</p>
