Abstract
------

* An open source tool named SimpleTree, capable of modelling highly accurate cylindrical tree models from terrestrial laser scan point clouds, is presented and evaluated.
* All important functionalities, accessible in the software via buttons and dialogues, are described including the explanation of all necessary input parameters.


## 1 Introduction

>The proposed approach results in geometrical models **describing the complete above-ground woody tree components in an hierarchical order**. Such models can be referred to as **Quantitative Structure Models (QSMs)**. [8–11]

>The SimpleTree method described here produces **topologically ordered cylinder parameters (size, orientation)** for all branches resolved by the LiDAR data, which can be of the order of thousands of branches per tree.

### 1.1 Related Work

>Yao et al. [25] predict AGB on plot level utilizing the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an input variable for the following allometric equation:

$$ AGB = a \times DBH^b \quad (1) $$

#### 1.1.1 Methods in Computational Forestry producing QSMs of the Branching Structure

>* In Côté et al. [42] TLS points are subdivided into **wood** and **foliage** components. 
>* Then **Dijkstra’s algorithm** is applied on the wood points to calculate a skeleton representing the stem and the major branches. 
>* To reconstruct the thinner branching structure, high occurrences of foliage are detected in voxel space. Those voxels are called attractors and are connected to the main skeleton in an iterative routine. 
>* Radii for cylinder estimations from the final skeleton are estimated from the **pipe model theory** [43]. 
>* Finally, foliage is added to the models.

#### 1.1.2 Methods in Computer Vision producing QSMs of the Branching Structure

>Here the idea of using sphere-surface cuts with point clouds of trees is utilized. This idea is based on Jayaratna [66] in the field of computer vision.

#### 1.1.3 Further Open Source Tree Modelling Software and Point Cloud Processing Libraries

>* Computree [70] is an open source platform utilizing TLS clouds.
>* Some of the algorithms implemented in Computree are described in detail in Othmani et al. and Ravaglia et al. [71,72].
>* The **Computational Geometry Algorithms Library** [73] offers geometric algorithms for the computation of Voronoi diagrams, α-shapes, convex hulls and other structures.
>* Both the **Point Cloud Library (PCL)** [74] and the **Sorted Pulse Data software Library (SPDLib)** [75] give access to methods specialized in the processing of LiDAR point clouds.

### 1.2 Relevance of the Presented Work in the State of the Art

>QSMs though have the beneficial potential to model also AGB distributions **within a single tree individual**, see Section 6.

### 1.3 Structure of the Manuscript

>* **Section 2** describes the functionalities of the presented software. SimpleTree results are compared to the results of the software tool relying on Raumonen et al. [49]. 
>* In **Section 3** this comparison method is described. 
>* The utilized data sets are presented in **Section 4**. 
>* In **Section 5** results of AGB estimations of both software tools are given. 
>* The results are discussed and interpreted in **Section 6**, leading to **Section 8** where the relevance of the tool is debated. 
>* An outlook of possible future work is given in **Section 7**.



## 2 Software—SimpleTree

>* The presented version of software SimpleTree is written in C++.
>* The **PCL** library [74] provides efficient functions for the implementation of the method. PCL’s mathematical operations are based on the linear algebra library **Eigen** [79]. k-nearest neighbour searches are performed by the **Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbours (FLANN)** [80]. PCL also ships with its own visualization library based on **VTK (the Visualization Toolkit)** [81].
